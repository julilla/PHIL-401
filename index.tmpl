        <p class="lead">How can we design computer systems that protect users' privacy? This special topics course investigates this question.</p>

        <p><b>Course Summary.</b>
        The goal of CSCI 2390 is to understand privacy-related challenges for computer systems, learn what design trade-offs we face as engineers, and to identify new research directions that might help address these challenges.
        We will examine research papers on distributed system design, privacy-preserving, and secure computing techniques, and discuss how to apply these ideas in practice.
        The goal is to understand if, and how, we can answer questions like these:
        <ul>
          <li>What happens to information we entrust to web services (e.g., email, photo sharing, social networks); how do companies store, process, and share it?
          <li>What requirements does privacy legislation &mdash; such as the EU's <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> &mdash; impose on the computer systems involved?
          <li>Can better protect this sensitive data, both against leaks and against unauthorized or unethical use?
        </ul>
        We will look at web services, datacenter systems, distributed communication systems, and machine learning systems.
        During class, you will present and discuss papers, finish small hands-on assignments, work on a research project, and present your project at the end of the semester.</p>
