MTG 1: Introduction

Was good overall, though timing was an issue. I got through most of my
boards.

The course structure part should have come earlier and should have been
made more explicit; some people clearly didn't hear about the questions.

Some students may have found the drift of my questions too simplistic,
and may have been frustrated.
