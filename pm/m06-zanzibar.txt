Spent first half on more GDPR presentations.

Zanzibar

Presentation was okay, but not great. Amir basically carbon-copied the ATC
talk with his own slide design, and it's not 100% clear he knew what was
going on.

I took control of the discussion when it wasn't really getting going and
Amir said some things that were wrong. My explanation of Zookies (with
student involvement) ended up being unstructured and wonky.

Lots of context on Spanner and TrueTime needed to understand the system.
Perhaps it's not a good paper to start with, as it's not super clearly
written.

Did a clearer zookie example at the start of next meeting.
