MTG 3: GDPR

Good discussion in the beginning, but slipped into me asking questions on
the details of subject access rights, and getting only hesitant responses.

DS, DC, DP discussion was good.

Maybe should have focused less on details of subject requests?

People seemed a bit bored towards the end.

Timing was okay, but I ran out of time towards the end of the subject rights
and had to skip protection by design & default, security of processing,
processors, notifcations, and fines. Some key points from those sections
would have been preferable to details about subject rights.
