Jearson's presentation was good, and he took my advice to heart.

This was perhaps the best session in terms of discussion so far. Riverbed
lent itself to this because it is fairly easy to grasp, and has some fairly
obvious problems.

I feel that I jumped in at the right places and generally improved
understanding. For example, the TPM explanation from first principles
seemed helpful, and my points about good/bad applications and about the
memory overhead landed well.
