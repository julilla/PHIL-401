MTG 02: Datacenter Stack

My notes didn't work, no chance to look at them.

Going around the room at the start was good, but I bungled it by giving
them two options as to what to say (what you learned, and what questions
you have; almost everyone went for the questions and repeated their
submitted question).

Almost all discussion was about TAO, hardly any about the Google WSC book
chapter. Explaining the TAO architecture and why FB works the way it does
seemed to go down well, although some people clearly already knew about
the distributed systems problems addressed here. Others said terms, but did
not seem to understand their details.

I wasn't working towards a clear problem; the privacy checks in the
frontend don't seem like that much of an issue perhaps (because I didn't
have a good case for why association lists need filtering, and because it
actually avoids huge backend store overheads). But I think they still got
the point.

Discussion at the end was too short and dimissive on my part. Should have
let them speculate, or skipped it.
