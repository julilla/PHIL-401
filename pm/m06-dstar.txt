This went well! First did Zanzibar zookie examples, and I think everyone got
it mostly this time around.

Presentation was strong and very interactive. I helped out a bit when
slow-stepping was needed. Anktia ran out of time because I had consumed half
an hour for my Zanzibar examples.

Would probably do HiStar next time; DStar's distributed components add even
more complexity. We actually spent most of the time doing HiStar examples,
and the ideas there came across clearly.

First class I was satisfied with at the end.
