Presentation went well, Archer was well prepared and made it quite interactive.

I bungled a few explanations of computing on faceted values and specifically why it's
okay to do faceted computation over private data, but not okay to do normal computation
over that date. Picked some poor ad-hoc examples (data dependent policies, why can't
prune early always); would have been good to have thought about them beforehand.

Nevertheless I feel that they largely got the gist of the paper, and can compare and
contrast with other solutions (Resin, DStar).
