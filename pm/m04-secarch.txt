I was underprepared. Idea of red team/blue team worked somewhat, but I still
had to steer the discussion a lot; I had hoped for more back and forth
between them. Would also have benefitted from a clearer goal (get some
customer's data? many people's? Podesta emails?) and a more structured
evaluation of different concerns -- the freedom of the red team to choose
its attack meant that we ended up with very advanced attacks early on.

Should have discussed why HW/BIOS attacks are particularly insidious (even
reinstalling machine doesn't get rid of backdoor).

Ran a bit out of steam towards the end (~20 min before end) and felt that
I just rambled along some random points in an unstructured way. Not much
signal if I was actually teaching them something new.

A few new people showed up; a few students who hadn't said much before spoke
up this time.
