I was underprepared. Idea of red team/blue team worked somewhat, but I still
had to steer the discussion a lot; I had hoped for more back and forth
between them.

Ran a bit out of steam towards the end (~20 min before end) and felt that
I just rambled along some random points in an unstructured way. Not much
signal if I was actually teaching them something new.

A few new people showed up; a few students who hadn't said much before spoke
up this time.
