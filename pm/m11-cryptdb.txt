I felt this was chaotic, and many people left still not completely
understanding the paper. This came partly because the paper had more
crypto than prior papers, partly because Connor's presentation was
somewhat scatter-brained, and partly because some of my interventions
were intended to be helpful but drove us into tangents or didn't jive
well with a point Connor was trying to make.

About 2/3 through, it became clear that some basic understanding was
still missing, so I walked through an example on the whiteboard. This
helped, but my board planning was poor and the text likely very hard
to read, so I'm not sure all points got through. Should have a better
planned example next time.

We also didn't get to discussing the fine-grained thread 2 scenario
at all, and there remained confusion about when onion layers are added
and removed.
