I felt well-prepared, though only answered two questions.

Presentation was unfortunately not good -- too much material just
paraphrasing the paper. Some students left early.

I think I did a decent job explaining the attacks and intuition behind
Resin (big runtime box, with all "doors" checked by filter objects, and
data objects have attached policy objects).

Will start talking to the presenters prior to their presentations.
