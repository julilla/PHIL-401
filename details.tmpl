<h4>Course Description</h4>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<a name="req">

<p>This is an advanced, research-focused course, but undergraduate students are most welcome!
The course staff are keen to guide you, but the course will benefit us all the most if you
take initiative.
Students should know <em>something</em> about distributed systems and have <em>some></em>
experience programming in systems languages before taking this course.
For example, this might result from having taken one or more prior courses, such as:
<ul>
  <li><a href="/courses/csci0330/">CSCI 0330: Introduction to Computer Systems</a>: gives you
  a foundation in concurrent programming; this couse will assume a 0330-level understanding.
  <li><a href="/courses/csci1380/s19/">CSCI 1380: Distributed Computer Systems</a>: a good
  preparation in terms of distributed systems context and principles.
  <li><a href="/courses/csci0320/">CSCI 0320: Introduction to Software Engineering</a>: gives
  you principles of scalable software engineering and prepares you well for the final project;
  without other prior classes, you will have to learn a lot about distributed systems quickly.
  <li><a href="/courses/csci1320/">CSCI 1320: Creating Modern Web Applications</a>: will have
  given you context on web services and their backends; some distributed systems concepts
  might be a little tough without CSCI 1380.
</ul>
Any other interested students are welcome, but should get in touch with
<a href="/people/malte">Malte</a> before signing up.
