<h2>Projects</h2>

<div class="alert alert-danger"><b>Not updated for 2020 yet!</b></div>

<p>Final projects should seek to answer a research question through implementation of a new idea in a
real system. This could take one of several forms:
<ul>
  <li>Prototype a new, privacy-centered system design.
  <li>Apply a privacy-enhancing or privacy-preserving technique in an existing system, and measure its impact.
  <li>Conduct a study of privacy risks and deficiencies in existing software, and analyze what it would take to address them.
</ul>
</p>

<p>You may work on projects individually, or in groups of two to three students. Your project deliverables include a proposal,
a progress report and poster presentation, a final paper describing design and implementation, your code, and a presentation
I will post the final presentation and writeup to the course website (unless you explicitly want it kept confidential for a
good reason).</p>

<h5>Important dates</h5>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li><b>October 2, 2020</b>: submit your project proposal (by 11pm).
  <li><b>October 29, 2020</b>: first project conference, at which you present your progress.
  <li><b>November 6, 2020</b>: submit a progress report on your project (by 11pm).
  <li><b>November 19, 2020</b>: second project conference, at which you present your progress.
  <li><b>December 2, 2020</b>: <a href="assign/final-report.html">submit</a> your code and final report.
  <li><b>December 3, 2020</b>: <a href="assign/final-report.html">presentation and demo</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Project proposal</h3>

<p>Please use the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/requirements-authors">OSDI 2018 submission template</a>.
Your proposal should be a one-page summary of what your idea is, how you
plan to go about investigating it, and what techniques you will apply (or need to learn about beyond the course material).</p>

<h3>Project ideas</h3>

<p>Here's a list of some starter ideas to get you thinking. Please feel free to pursue your own ideas!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add support for GDPR Subject Access Requests (SARs) and data deletion requests to an open-source web application.
  <li>Write a GDPR-compliant subject access and erasure tool for <a href="https://hotcrp.com">HotCRP</a>.
  <li>Design a language for machine-readable privacy policies, and a way to verify or enforce that a web application follows these policies.
  <li>Build a <a href="readings/multiversedb.pdf">multiverse database</a> extension for MySQL or PostgreSQL (perhaps using the Postgres extension API).
  <li>Implement <a href="readings/compliance-by-construction.pdf">GDPR compliance by construction</a> in an existing web framework or storage system.
  <li>Investigate provable GDPR compliance for a simple storage system (e.g., a key-value store).
  <li>Check out the ideas for decentralized application projects from <a href="http://nil.lcs.mit.edu/6.S974/more.html">MIT's 6.S974</a>.
</ul>
