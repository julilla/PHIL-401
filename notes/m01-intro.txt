CSCI 2390 2019 Meeting 1: Introduction

CSCI 2390: Privacy-Conscious Computer Systems

What does the course title mean?
  Realistic systems whose design takes user privacy into account.
  "Conscious" because this is about adding privacy-awareness to
  systems that have some other primary purpose.

This is an important area because computers process ever more of our
sensitive personal information, often remotely and away from devices that
we directly control ourselves. Legislatures are setting new rules, and
scrutiny of big web and IT companies has increased.

What's the point?

How might we get there?

What research is there to do?
