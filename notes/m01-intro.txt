CSCI 2390 2020 Meeting 1: Introduction

CSCI 2390: Privacy-Conscious Computer Systems

What does the course title mean?
  Realistic systems whose design takes user privacy into account.
  "Conscious" because this is about adding privacy-awareness to
  systems that have some other primary purpose.

This is an important area because computers process ever more of our
sensitive personal information, often remotely and away from devices that
we directly control ourselves. This has increased the potential for data
to be leaked, stolen, or misused, either intentionally or unintentionally.
As a result, legislatures are setting new rules, and scrutiny of big web
and IT companies has increased.

What will we do?
  Read, present, and discuss research papers.
  Try our practical systems.
  Complete a research project of your own.

INTRODUCTIONS

Course structure
  https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2390/2020
  today: overview and discussion about privacy
  further meetings will be paper discussions (not lectures)
    either about a research paper, or a piece of software/project
  from meeting 4 onwards, you will present papers
    presentation (~30 min)
      highlight key ideas and lessons
      track down hard details (may want to read further related work)
      raise questions for discussion
      if possible, try out the program or system
      don't worry, I'll help
    each discussion (50 min) has leaders
      sign up via form linked from the schedule page for a paper to lead
      everyone should read and think about every paper
        NOT just turn up and wait for the discussion leads to explain!
        prepare to ask and answer questions!
      critique/support the work
        on a technical level (correctness, methods, performance?)
        on a pragmatic level (deployable, practical, flexile?)
  assignment: paper questions
    set questions about the paper
    space to ask *your* questions
    submit answers by 11pm on the day before class
  two larger assignments
    1. request your personal data from web services and analyze it
    2. a GDPR case study & presentation
    due on Fri Sept 18 and Sept 25
  project
    pick a research idea, inspired by the course or related
    design, build and evaluate solution, check if the idea is good
    proposal (due Oct 2)
    project conferences
    report, final short presentation
    groups of 2-3 students encouraged, but can work on your own too

Paper reading
  research papers dense and can be tough reads
  allow at least 1-2 hours per paper
    you'll get better/quicker at this over time
  technique
    first pass, 5-10 minutes: get general idea
      read title, abstract, intro, perhaps conclusions
    second pass, 1 hour+: understand the details
      what is the problem?
      what is the solution/approach proposed?
      how does it compare with previous work?
      how well does it work?
    now, make a judgement
      do you like the paper?
      do you think its technique works for the application(s) it targets?
      do you think the system/technique is realistic for practical use?
      what issues do you see with the design described?
      what takeaways/ideas are important to remember?
    if you are the presenter/lead for a paper, you will want to answer
    the above questions ("second pass") in your presentation, and ensure
    the judgement questions get discussed

Constitutional podcast episode
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/constitutional/episode--privacy/
  what is privacy?
    "right to be left alone"
    protection from state, other individuals, corporations
  notion has evolved over time
    ex: American revolution in part about protection of property
      from search and seizure without warrant
      4th amendment to U.S. constitution explicit about this
      => protection from state
    ex: tabloid press around 1900
      protection of individual from distress due to gossip
      Brandeis tort laws
      recent: Hulk Hogan vs. Gawker media
      => protection from media/other individuals
    ex: Olmstead vs. U.S.
      wiretapping, new technology, how does 4th amendment apply?
      => protection from state abusing new tech
    ex: Carpenter vs. U.S.
      new tech vs. third party doctrine
      giving information to 3rd party => loss of expectation of privacy
      very problematic with today's technology!
      => protection from goverment, but also 3rd parties
  Q: what does privacy mean on the internet today?


For next Tuesday:
  read paper on targeted advertising on Twitter
  submit & answer questions online
