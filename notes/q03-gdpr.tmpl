The law is vague on this, and does not define "delete" or "erase". I
suspect it ought to be interpreted in the sense of deleting the bytes
(through the filesystem and through overwriting), rather than destroying
the storage medium beyond any chance of recovery, but courts may have to
interpret the law here.

The GDPR does specify that data controllers shall keep a "record of
processing activity", which includes "where possible, the envisaged time
limits for erasure of the different categories of data" (ยง30(1)f). In
practice, many companies tell data subjects in their privacy policies that
complete erasure can take a while (e.g., 180 days at Google), as
information also has to be removed from tape backups, age out of caches,
etc.

This is an open question! The GDPR has no explicit provision for this,
although it sets much laxer requirements for processing of data once it is
no longer associated with an identifiable data subject. You could argue
that the impact of one subject's data on a model's parameters is so small
and diluted that the model no longer contains data covered by the right to
erasure. How to make sure that's the case, though, is an open research
question...

Yes. Data can have more than one controller, but the controller that
originally collected and shared the data is responsible for notifying other
controllers of subject requests. See, e.g., Article 17(2). Third party
organizations outside the Union are covered by Chapter V (Articles 44 and
following).

As above, once the data is no longer associated with an identifiable data
subject, many GDPR provisions no longer apply. An aggregation that obscures
each subject's contribution sufficiently therefore seems to no longer
belong to the subjects, but to the aggregating controller.

Yes, it does. Some companies even decided to stop offering services to
people in the EU or geoblock all EU users of their website. See the
"Impact" paragraph on p2 of
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/papers/hotcloud19-gdpr-sins.pdf for some

Other companies have tried to adapt their services, but they do have to
work with new restrictions, and spend significant resources on compliance.

I believe that is a correct reading. But the GDPR does not aim to make
privacy breaches impossible; it just imposes hefty reputational and
financial costs on them, hoping that this will encourage good practices.

The law does not mandate specific compliance demonstrations. In practice,
this often involves auditors (companies like KPMG and other consultancies),
who look at a controller's processes and certify them as compliant.

Article 42 talks about EU-wide certification mechanisms and authorities,
but they seem to be voluntary.

I would guess because the GDPR wants to give data subjects reasons to trust
that their data isn't going to just disappear when they entrust it to a
controller/processor. In particular, security against hackers who may
delete the data could be one goal of the requirement for secure storage and
processing.

Your case is extra tricky because the data subjects are deceased, raising
questions about whether personal data is protected after death. The GDPR
does not speak to this, but existing legislation does (with varying
outcomes depending on purpose).

However, the GDPR does get quite excited about scientific research in the
public interest; see paragraphs (156)-(162) of the long list at the top of
the legislation. Article 89 explicitly says that other requirements can be
"abrogated" (i.e., the requirements of the GDPR suspended) as long as
certain rules specified in ยง89(1) are followed.

Articles 17 (Right to Erasure) and 18 (Right to Objection) also have
special exceptions for scientific research, which in particular leave open
the option of a "public interest" argument to override explicit
instructions from the data subject (e.g., Article 18: "Where personal data
are processed for scientific [...] pursuant to Article 89(1), the data
subject, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, shall have
the right to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her,
unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried
out for reasons of public interest.")

The process for creating a EU regulation is long and complex;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_legislative_procedure#Ordinary_legislative_procedure
has an overview. In a nutshell, the European Commission (consisting of
commissioners nominated by the member states) makes a proposal, which both
the European Parliament (elected directly by citizens) and the European
Council (representing the member state governments) decide on. Once
everybody approves, the regulation is approved and member states' national
parliaments pass legislation that enforces the regulatio in national law.

I would speculate that better protection of privacy and fundamental rights
to control over one's data was a major reason that the GDPR came about.
There had been earlier regulations on this topic (from the 1990s), but they
were outdated, far less broadly construed, and did not allow for serious
fines for violations. So the GDPR is partly an effort to update these rules
given how much the Internet and digital services have changed since the
1990s.

> 1. How are fines enforced if a company has no presence in the EU?

Fines are imposed by national "supervisory authorities" (data protection
agencies, typically). How they are enforced on non-EU companies is a matter
of international law -- you can sue businesses in other countries, and a
court will adjudicate the matter. In practical terms, a business that
failed to pay the fine could also run the risk of having assets and
proceeds that pass through the EU seized, and possibly senior
representatives of the company arrested if they travel into the EU.

Absolutely. The law assumes that the risk of someone finding out,
complaining, and a fine being imposed on the company is sufficient
deterrent to make the company send all data. In practice, this seems to be
tricky and requires pushback from data subjects, as e.g., this Spotify case
illustrates: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1025024813889478656.

You're right. Some companies decided to stop offering services to people in
the EU or geoblock all EU users of their website. See the "Impact"
paragraph on p2 of
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/papers/hotcloud19-gdpr-sins.pdf for some
examples. This will need to be worked out over time; I suspect compliance
will just become part of the cost of doing business (like compliance with
other laws is). Blockchains are an interesting case, since they have a hard
time satisfying the right to erasure; a GDPR-compliant blockchain might be
an be an interesting project or research topic!

It's quite new, so the effectiveness is still unclear. However, a fair
number of fines have already been imposed (see the links from the GDPR case
study assignment page). Compared to historic privacy regulation
enforcement, it seems like the GDPR is being enforced much more
aggressively. But we don't know what fraction of actual violations the
enforcements cover, of course.

They would not typically have the resources to do that. In practice,
companies often rely on  external auditors (companies like KPMG and other
business consultancies), who look at a data controller's or data
processor's technology and processes and certify them as compliant.

This is a great idea, I think!  The Polisis paper that we'll read on
November 26 (MTG 23) goes some way down this path (
http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2390/readings/polisis.pdf), applying
automated analysis to classify privacy policies. But we might also want to
think about what a CC-style taxonomy of privacy policy options should look
like, and encourage companies to use this taxonomy rather than writing
complex natural language policies.

The GDPR only says "It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent"
(Article 7(3)), but a reasonable interpretation would be that this covers
withdrawing consent in writing, either by physical letter or electronic
communication through established channels.

I believe you could object to processing while waiting for deletion, as
long as the processing is not required for deletion itself.

There is no mandated technical means of verification that the data are
deleted. You have to trust the company not to break the law.

Ultimately, this is adjudicated by courts (i.e., it's in the public
interest if you can convince a judge that it is). If a controller claims a
spurious public interest reason and someone complains, the supervisory
authority will investigate and may fine them. The controller can appeal,
and ultimately this goes in front of a court.

The GDPR gives some ideas of what might constitute public interest research
in paragraphs (156)-(162) at the top of the legislation, but remains vague
as it's impossible to exhaustively enumerate all permitted uses.

It depends on whether there is metadata that identifies the encrypted data
as yours. If so, the controller can delete them without decrypting and
satisfy the erasure request. If the identification itself is hidden by
encryption and the data controller has no access to it, the erasure request
cannot be satisfied until the identification is revealed to the controller,
but it would have to immediately be satisfied at that point according to my
understanding.

In practice, most controllers will make sure that they can identify the
data associated with a subject, even if it is encrypted.

Yes, it is, according to my reading, if the original controller had reason
to believe that it was still possible, with reasonable costs and effort, to
deanonymize subjects in their dataset through combination with other
information. The GDPR differentiates between "pseudonymization" (anonymous,
but identifiable with extra information) and full "anonymization" (no
identification possible). Anonymized data are not covered by the GDPR, but
pseudonymized data are.

Paragraph (26) at the top of the legislation specifies some constraints:
"To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be
taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out,
either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural
person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably
likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken
of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time
required for identification, taking into consideration the available
technology at the time of the processing and technological developments."

The article says that controllers and processors must "[take] into account
the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope,
context and purposes of processing as well as the risk" and must "implement
appropriate technical [...] measures". The Caesar cipher or some other form
of weak encryption is unlikely to pass that bar. Again the specific
boundaries (is MD5 fine for pseudonymization? Is SHA-1? what's a
state-of-the-art key management technology?) will need to be sussed out by
the court precedent.

Yes, it does; as per above.

My reading is that there is no requirement to reveal the processor. This
might be because many companies would consider this sensitive information,
because it might e.g., expose the processor to attacks or undermine their
competitive advantage.

As for transit, the general stipulations of data protection by design and
default (Article 25) and security of processing (Article 32) apply there.

They are likely purposefully vague. Legislation always needs to strike a
balance between being sufficiently specific to be enforceable and
sufficiently vague to be timeless and cover all cases it is intended to
cover. We rely on external interpretation (courts, judicial precedents) to
nail down the details, which may well change over time.

Larger, public companies publish their turnover numbers, so they're easy to
find. Smaller ones also report them, e.g., for tax purposes, so a
supervisory authority can find out (or they can just ask someone under
oath). The GDPR is careful to make fines threatening for both small and
large companies by specifying the amount as "up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in
the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % [of turnover], whichever is higher".
In other words, individuals can be fined up to 20M, and any "undertaking"
(entity engaged in economic activity, including non-profits, public bodies,
small enterprises) can be fined max(4% turnover, 20Mโฌ).

The EU delegates enforcement to national supervisory authorities  (usually
national data protection agencies).

Supervisory authorities have oversight, but often delegate it in turn as
they have limited resources. In practice, companies often rely on external
auditors (companies like KPMG and other business consultancies), who look
at a data controller's or data processor's technology and processes and

The company could be fined even without an incident. For example, someone
may find out about shady practice or an employee might become a

This is still up in the air, and I imagine we'll see the limits being
figured out in the courts over the next few years. Paragraph (32) of the
principles at the top of the legislation says:

"Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely
given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's
agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such
as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral
statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet
website, choosing technical settings for information society services or
another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the
data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal
data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore
constitute consent."

This would seem to suggest that long policies that nobody will read in
practice are considered okay (which is already the case in contract law for
other purposes, unfortunately). However, Article 7 also says that "the
request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly
distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily
accessible form, using clear and plain language", and "accessible" suggests
that it has to be available to users with impairments or screenreaders.

Some companies decided to stop offering services to people in the EU or

will just become part of the cost of doing business (like compliance with
other laws is).

You're right that many users will probably just agree to whatever the
website asks them to consent to. The law has to walk a fine line between
giving people the agency to make their own educated (or uneducated)
decisions and prescribing behavior; in general, the law tends to err on the
side of assuming educated citizens who are able to make these decisions
(with some exceptions, such as children, that the GDPR handles explicitly).

I believe they try to comply! The cost of repeat fines is high, and they
probably don't want to get fined 4% of their turnover every year.

However, it's slow and expensive to change internal processes, and it will
likely take a while for companies to become fully compliant. They will also
watch how aggressively the GDPR is enforced and what precedents courts set
in terms of what companies must do.

One way to think about this is that systems should make the relationship

return all data associated with a subject. Right now, this often has to be
retroactively inferred, causing expensive and manual labor.

I personally see it as an opportunity, and many privacy advocates think it

small companies and websites, who now have to understand and correctly
apply fairly complex regulations.
