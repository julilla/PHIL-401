You can choose a provider under "settings" -> "storage providers" in the Blockstack account (https://browser.blockstack.org/account/storage). This <a href="https://docs.blockstack.org/storage/overview.html#user-control-or-how-is-gaia-decentralized">description</a> suggests that operating a hub involves running both an active component (e.g., a VM) and using a passive storage service on a cloud provider (confirmed for EC2 <a href="https://docs.blockstack.org/storage/amazon-s3-deploy.html">here</a>).

> One thing that really surprised me about Blockstack was its decision to be built on top of existing Internet protocols. That makes sense. Coming up with new protocols is a lot of work. What surprised me specifically was that this decision would allow ANY web browser to access Blockstack. The closest parallel I can think of would be something like the Tor Browser. In fact, I honestly expected a required USER-END layer to keep security. Would this have added anything?

There is a client-side story, which involves the private key being stored within client browser (see <a href="https://forum.blockstack.org/t/obtaining-identity-keys-from-the-browser/4663">here</a>), and a JS library referred to in the documentation as the "blockstack browser". This client library accesses the private key and generates from it per-application keys that are then used to encrypt/decrypt the application data. This client-side library is trusted (though it's open source, so you can in theory audit it).

If your concern is that your browser vendor (e.g., Google) may be trying to attack you, Blockstack indeed does not prevent such an attack, as the browser has access to the plaintext data displayed. That seems hard to avoid though!

> I don't know much about the specifics of blockchain, but isn't using a blockchain-based anything an extreme energy burner? Would the security benefits outweigh the battery drain on our devices or the increased power bill for my desktop?

The energy is not necessarily burned on your device. Bitcoin burns a lot of energy at the "miners" (peers who add blocks to the chain and get paid in bitcoin in return), but not at the clients who submit transactions. However, you do have to pay for transactions to be added to the Bitcoin block chain, so Blockstack is presumably paying a small amount every time they add a name registration.

Remember that the blockchain in Blockstack is only required for ID/name registration (which is a rare event). Name registration writes a transaction to the blockchain that contains both a hash of the user's public key and a hash of their zone file, which points to the user profile stored on Gaia. See the example of my Blockstack ID <a href="https://registrar.blockstack.org/v1/names/malteschwarzkopf.id.blockstack">here</a>. This ties a particular user's key pair to a zone file, and thus to a Blockstack ID. The user's public key is stored unencrypted in Gaia, so that it's easily accessible -- in fact, it's part of the profile data (see <a href="https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/18KqXwkQNEVDacN834YQVWZoCdiFVSa57D/profile.json">here</a> for mine).

Raw application data is only stored in Gaia, and the process of accessing it is explained <a href="https://docs.blockstack.org/storage/overview.html#user-control-or-how-is-gaia-decentralized">here</a> (scroll to below the picture). Users choose where to host their Gaia data (the default is on gaia.blockstack.org, but you can run your own Gaia hub if you're paranoid, or use S3, or Google Cloud, etc.), and the zonefile contains a pointer to the user's profile.json file. That file contains profile information, including where the data for different applications is stored (e.g., in my profile, there are entries for three applications, all pointing to URLs under gaia.blockstack.org/hub).

So for an application like YouTube, the blockchain would not be involved beyond account registration, and certainly not in the actual video streaming.

I'm not 100% sure this is the reason, but the page seems to download a lot of JavaScript. blockstack.js, the main client library, is 1.2 MB in minified form, so one guess would be that the browser needs to JIT-compile a large amount of JS code.
