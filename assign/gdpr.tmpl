<h2>Assignment 1: GDPR Case Study</h2>

<p style="color: red;"><b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION: this assignment is still incomplete and will be updated soon!
Please be patient while we put this new course together.</b></p>

<p>In this assignment, you will investigate a documented violation of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), learn
the details of the case, and present it to the class.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Choose a case</h4>

<p>The first thing to do is to pick a case that you will look into and present. Records of GDPR violations are available online
in many locations, including <a href="http://www.enforcementtracker.com/">here</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/lknik/gdpr/blob/master/fines/README.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>Choose a case that you find interesting, and enter it in <a href="">this spreadsheet</a>. Please make sure to avoid duplicates.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Find out the facts</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Why was a fine imposed? Which articles of the GDPR were violated, and by whom?
  <li>What went wrong on a technical level?
  <li>What personal data was exposed/mishandled, and in what way?
  <li>How could this have been prevented?
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Write a report</h4>

<h4>Step 4: In-class presentation</h4>
